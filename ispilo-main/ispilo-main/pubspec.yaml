# Launcher icon generation (optional helper)

# Add your icon PNG to assets/images/Ispilo.png (or assets/images/Ispilo_padded.png for extra safe padding)

  android: true
  ios: true

  # Use the padded version for safe art bounds. If you prefer the original
  # unpadded PNG, change this to assets/images/Ispilo.png
